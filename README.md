# Memory Allocator in C++ Language: Data Structures in C++ Homework

## Task 

The library you are implementing in this project must work on a pre-allocated memory block. It must respond to the *alloc \<size\>* and *free \<ptr\>* commands. You need to choose an efficient memory allocation algorithm that works with randomly sized blocks. Validate working with directories (ie, protect yourself against incorrect or double memory freezing). Try working with different algorithms. If you can - demonstrate the usage of the library with standard containers in stl.
